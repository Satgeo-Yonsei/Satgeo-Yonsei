      title: Who We Are
      text: |
        This is the webpage of the Satellite Geosciences Research Group at the Department of Earth System Sciences, Yonsei University.
        The group is led by Hahn Chul Jung, and the research that we do focuses on radar remote sensing, 
        land information system, natural disaster monitoring, 
        and the study of large-schale hydrology.
        
        What we do in our lab is as follows : 
        satellite data processing and develop algorithms for earth observation, 
        modeling implementation using satellite-based input data,
        analysis & understanding of natural phenomena using satellite data and modeling.
